about: Suggest an idea for Dependabot

---

<!--
Thank you for suggesting an idea to make Dependabot better.

We're a small team, so there's a limit to how much we can work on at once, but
we're always interested in your ideas. Please also note that
[Dependabot Core](https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core) is a public
repo, so in some cases you may be able to submit a pull request for your idea.

To contact the Dependabot team privately you can email support@dependabot.com
